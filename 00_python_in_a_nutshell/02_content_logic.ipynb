The expression after the `in` references the \"thing\" that is looped over (here: a `list` of `numbers`) and the name between `for` and `in` becomes a variable that is assigned a new value in each **iteration** over of the loop. A best practice is to use a meaingful name, which is why we choose the singular `number`. The `:` at the end is the charactistic symbol of a header line in general and requires the next line (and possibly many more lines) to be **indented**.\n",
